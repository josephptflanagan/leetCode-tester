# LeetCode Algorithm Javascript Tester (leetCode-tester)

## Description
This very basic program will serve to allow me to test LeetCode Algorithm problems on my own before submission, and will serve as a repository of algorithms that I can easily reference when need be.

### Proper Usage
As it stands this is a very low tech platform that requires manual effort to change which algoritm is currently active, and the inputs for this algorithm. At this time this will serve my needs, but I may increase its automation at a later date for easier usage.
